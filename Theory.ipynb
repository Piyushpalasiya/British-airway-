    "# Step 2: Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into smaller pieces called Tokens. It can be performed at sentences(sentence tokenization) or word level(word tokenization).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Enrichment â€“ POS tagging\n",
    "Parts of Speech (POS) tagging is a process of converting each token into a tuple having the form (word, tag). POS tagging essential to preserve the context of the word and is essential for Lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Stopwords removal\n",
    "Stopwords in English are words that carry very little useful information. We need to remove them as part of text preprocessing. nltk has a list of stopwords of every language.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Obtaining the stem words\n",
    "A stem is a part of a word responsible for its lexical meaning. The two popular techniques of obtaining the root/stem words are Stemming and Lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is Stemming often gives some meaningless root words as it simply chops off some characters in the end. Lemmatization gives meaningful root words, however, it requires POS tags of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along \n",
    "with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, \n",
